Pipeline Overview

The script executes the following major tasks:

    Data Quality Assessment: Utilizes FastQC to assess the quality of raw FASTQ reads.
    Quality and Adapter Trimming: Uses fastp to trim the reads and remove adapters.
    Indexing Reference Genome: Builds an index for the reference genome using HISAT2.
    Read Mapping: Maps the trimmed reads to the reference genome with HISAT2, including an option to filter out multi-mapped reads.
    Processing Alignments: Converts SAM files to BAM format, sorts them, and indexes the sorted BAM files using Samtools.
    Read Counting: Utilizes featureCounts to generate a count matrix from the aligned BAM files.
    Differential Expression Analysis: Runs a separate R script (DESeq2.r) to analyze differential expression based on the generated count matrix.

Prerequisites

    Software Requirements:
        FastQC
        fastp
        HISAT2
        Samtools
        featureCounts
        R and the DESeq2 package

Usage

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

Ensure that all the software dependencies are installed and accessible in your PATH.

Edit the script to set the appropriate paths for your environment if necessary.

Run the script:

bash

    bash RNASeq_Pipeline.sh

Output

    Output Directory: The script creates an Out_Analysis directory containing:
        QC reports
        Trimmed reads
        Alignment files (SAM and BAM)
        Count matrix (Count_matrix.txt)
        Sample information file (Sample_Info.txt)
    Differential Expression Results: The script calls an R script (DESeq2.r) for further analysis of the count data.
