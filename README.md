# RNA-Seq-Data-Analysis-Pipeline
This repository contains a Bash script designed for processing RNA-Seq data from raw FASTQ files to differential expression analysis using DESeq2. The pipeline performs several key steps, including quality assessment, trimming, alignment, and read counting, ultimately leading to the generation of a count matrix for subsequent analysis in R.
